/**
 * Represents the execution state of a tracked task. This enum defines the standard
 * lifecycle states that tasks transition through during execution.
 *
 * <p>State Transitions:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>PENDING ‚Üí RUNNING:</strong> Task begins execution</li>
 *   <li><strong>RUNNING ‚Üí SUCCESS:</strong> Task completes successfully</li>
 *   <li><strong>RUNNING ‚Üí FAILED:</strong> Task encounters an error</li>
 *   <li><strong>RUNNING ‚Üí CANCELLED:</strong> Task is explicitly cancelled</li>
 *   <li><strong>PENDING ‚Üí CANCELLED:</strong> Task is cancelled before starting</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Terminal States: {@link #SUCCESS}, {@link #FAILED}, and {@link #CANCELLED} are
 * terminal states - tasks should not transition from these states to any other state.
 *
 * <p>Usage in Status Updates:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Task starts
 * return new StatusUpdate<>(0.0, RunState.PENDING, this);
 *
 * // Task begins execution
 * return new StatusUpdate<>(0.0, RunState.RUNNING, this);
 *
 * // Task progresses
 * return new StatusUpdate<>(0.5, RunState.RUNNING, this);
 *
 * // Task completes
 * return new StatusUpdate<>(1.0, RunState.SUCCESS, this);
 * }</pre>
