# Contributor Guide

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are carefully reviewed before being merged. 
The following conventions and rules are adopted by the jvector project.

Before an open pull request is merged, it must have:
* all open conversations resolved in good faith
* at least one approval from a code owner of the affected source path
* at least one other approval from any authorized maintainer
* all green status on any build or test gates

Any pull request approvals should be reset when there are pushes to its branch.

With the appropriate gates in place, anybody may merge a PR.
The PR review and test gates are used to ensure when this is acceptable.

If, for some reason, a mergeable PR should not be merged,
a developer may do one of the following, for example:
* move it to draft state and update the description to explain the issue
* simply open a new conversation
