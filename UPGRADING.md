# Upgrading from 1.0.x to 2.0.x

## New features

- In-graph deletes are supported through `GraphIndexBuilder.markNodeDeleted`.  Deleted nodes
  are removed when `GraphIndexBuilder.cleanup` is called (which is not threadsafe wrt other concurrent changes).
  To write a graph with deleted nodes to disk, a `Map` must be supplied indicating what ordinals
  to change the remaining node ids to -- on-disk graphs may not contain "holes" in the ordinal sequence.
- `GraphSearcher.search` now has an experimental overload that takes a
  `float threshold` parameter that may be used instead of topK; (approximately) all the nodes with simlarities greater than the given threshold will be returned.
- Binary Quantization is available as an alternative to Product Quantization. Our tests show that it's primarily suitable for ada002 embedding vectors and loses too much accuracy with smaller embeddings.

## Primary API changes

- `GraphIndexBuilder.complete` is now `cleanup`.
- The `Bits` parameter to `GraphSearcher.search` is no longer nullable;
  pass `Bits.ALL` instead of `null` to indicate that all ordinals are acceptable.

## Other changes to public classes

- `NeighborQueue`, `NeighborArray`, and `NeighborSimilarity` have been renamed to
  `NodeQueue`, `NodeArray`, and `NodeSimilarity`, respectively.
