/**
 * Represents a graph-based vector index.  Nodes are represented as ints, and edges are
 * represented as adjacency lists.
 * <p>
 * Mostly this applies to any graph index, but a few methods (e.g. getVector()) are
 * specifically included to support the DiskANN-based design of OnDiskGraphIndex.
 * <p>
 * All methods are threadsafe.  Operations that require persistent state are wrapped
 * in a View that should be created per accessing thread.
